# Contact Management App

This is a RESTful API for managing contacts, with features for authentication, email notifications, liking/disliking, and blocking/unblocking contacts.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can register and log in, receiving a JSON Web Token (JWT) for secure access.
- **Contact Management**: Users can create, view, update, and delete contacts.
- **Email Notifications**: Users can send emails to contacts using the Nodemailer library.
- **Like and Dislike Contacts**: Users can like and dislike contacts, and the likes count is tracked.
- **Block and Unblock Contacts**: Users can block or unblock contacts to manage their interactions.
